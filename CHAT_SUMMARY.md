# AI Worker Prompt

You are an AI worker tasked with developing a Multi-Server Command-Line Interface (MCP-CLI) that enables dynamic routing and execution of tools across different service APIs. The project is transitioning from a single-server architecture to a flexible multi-server system that can handle parallel command execution and complex routing scenarios.

Your primary task is to continue the development of the multi-server support feature, focusing on resolving current server initialization issues and implementing robust command routing. You must ensure backward compatibility while adding new functionality, following the established branching strategy and commit guidelines.

The project uses Python 3.12.3 and Node.js 20.10.0, with a mix of Python packages and Node.js tools. Your immediate focus should be on debugging server initialization timeouts and resolving package dependency issues that are currently blocking progress.

Below you will find all the necessary details about the project structure, current status, and specific tasks that need attention. Use this information to understand the context and continue development effectively.

# AI Worker Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a multi-server command-line interface (MCP-CLI) that dynamically routes and executes tools across different service APIs. The project is transitioning from single-server to multi-server support.

## Branching Strategy
1. **Main Branches**:
   - `main`: Production-ready code
   - `feature/multi-server-support`: Main feature branch for multi-server implementation

2. **Development Flow**:
   - Create a new branch for each task: `task/your-task-name`
   - Branch off from `feature/multi-server-support`
   - Make changes and test thoroughly
   - Commit with descriptive messages
   - Create PR to merge into `feature/multi-server-support`
   - Once feature is complete, merge into `main`

3. **Commit Guidelines**:
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Include task reference if applicable
   - Group related changes in single commits
   - Test before committing

# MCP-CLI Development Chat Summary

## Project Context
- **Project**: Model Context Provider CLI (MCP-CLI)
- **Repository Location**: /Users/freebeiro/Documents/fcr/claudefiles/mcp-cli
- **Current Branch**: feature/multi-server-support

## Main Objective
Enable the MCP-CLI to work with multiple servers simultaneously, as currently it only supports connecting to one server at a time.

## Current State
- Single server connection support only
- Server configuration in `server_config.json`
- Command routing to single server
- Basic CLI interface for server interaction

## Planned Changes
We're implementing multi-server support in three phases:

### Phase 1: Configuration & Basic Structure
- [ ] Update configuration structure
- [ ] Create ServerManager class
- [ ] Basic multi-server connection handling

### Phase 2: Command Interface
- [ ] Add server context switching
- [ ] Implement new multi-server commands
- [ ] Update command routing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Parallel command execution
- [ ] Server group operations
- [ ] Enhanced status reporting

## Progress Log

### Session 1 (Current)
1. **Analysis**: 
   - Identified limitation in current architecture for single server support
   - Analyzed main.py and server_config.json for required changes
2. **Setup**:
   - Created new branch 'feature/multi-server-support'
   - Created this CHAT_SUMMARY.md file for tracking progress

## Current Task: Update Server Configuration
**Branch**: `task/update-server-config`

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Backup Current Configuration** (Safety Step) 
   - Create a backup of current server_config.json
   - Add to .gitignore to prevent committing backups

2. **Update Configuration Schema** (Small Change) 
   - Add version field to track config schema version
   - Add new fields while maintaining backward compatibility
   - Test loading of old config format still works

### Implementation Details
#### Configuration Changes
1. Created new `config_types.py` with:
   - `ServerGroup` class for managing server groups
   - `MCPConfig` class for type-safe configuration handling
   - Version-aware configuration loading
2. Updated `config.py`:
   - Made server_name parameter optional
   - Added support for loading multiple active servers
   - Maintained backward compatibility
3. Updated `server_config.json`:
   - Added version field (2.0.0)
   - Added serverGroups structure
   - Added activeServers list
4. Added `test_config.py`:
   - Test cases for v1 config format (backward compatibility)
   - Test cases for v2 config format
   - Test server parameter retrieval
   - Test active servers handling

#### Current Status
- [x] Configuration structure updated

## Investigated Issues
- Server initialization timeouts in stdio-based servers
- Stream management during server startup
- Ready message handling between client and server
- Message synchronization in multi-server setup

## Key Findings
1. Server successfully sends ready message but stream management is problematic
2. Multiple attempts to fix the issue revealed deeper architectural concerns:
   - Stream lifecycle management
   - Message synchronization
   - Client-server connection stability
3. Current initialization flow has potential race conditions
4. Logging shows message delivery but connection stability issues

## Next Steps
1. Investigate stream management during server startup
2. Review the entire server initialization flow
3. Consider implementing a more robust connection protocol
4. Add comprehensive logging for stream lifecycle events
5. Implement proper stream cleanup and error handling

## Development Principles
- Prioritize connection stability
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add detailed logging throughout the system
- Consider timeout configurations carefully

## Technical Decisions
- Will maintain backward compatibility with existing server configurations
- Planning to implement a new ServerManager class for handling multiple connections
- Will use async/await for managing multiple server connections
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - Main feature branch: `feature/multi-server-support`
  - Each task will have its own branch branching from `feature/multi-server-support`
  - Task branches will be merged back to `feature/multi-server-support`
  - Final feature will be merged to `main`

## Next Steps
Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation, starting with configuration structure updates.

## Notes
- This is a significant architectural change requiring careful testing
- Need to ensure backward compatibility for existing use cases
- Will need to update documentation to reflect new multi-server capabilities

## Latest Progress (2024-12-08)
