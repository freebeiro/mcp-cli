# AI Worker Prompt

You are an AI worker tasked with developing a Multi-Server Command-Line Interface (MCP-CLI) that enables dynamic routing and execution of tools across different service APIs. The project is transitioning from a single-server architecture to a flexible multi-server system that can handle parallel command execution and complex routing scenarios.

Your primary task is to continue the development of the multi-server support feature, focusing on resolving current server initialization issues and implementing robust command routing. You must ensure backward compatibility while adding new functionality, following the established branching strategy and commit guidelines.

The project uses Python 3.12.3 and Node.js 20.10.0, with a mix of Python packages and Node.js tools. Your immediate focus should be on debugging server initialization timeouts and resolving package dependency issues that are currently blocking progress.

## 📋 Critical Development Guidelines
1. Documentation & Updates
   - **REQUIRED**: All new meaningful changes MUST be documented in this summary
   - Keep the summary organized and up-to-date
   - Document both technical changes and process improvements
   - Update summary before closing any development session

2. Testing Requirements
   - **MANDATORY**: Every new implementation MUST have corresponding tests
   - Tests should cover both success and error cases
   - Integration tests required for multi-component features
   - No code merges without passing tests

3. Git Workflow
   - **REQUIRED**: Each new implementation MUST be in its own feature branch
   - No direct commits to main branch
   - Push only after ALL tests pass successfully
   - Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits
   - Create PR for review before merging

4. Configuration Management
   - **CRITICAL**: `server_config.json` is for external tools - DO NOT MODIFY
   - Use `server_config.json.example` for template
   - All sensitive data MUST be in environment variables
   - Keep external tool configurations separate from application code

Below you will find all the necessary details about the project structure, current status, and specific tasks that need attention. Use this information to understand the context and continue development effectively.

## Investigated Issues
- Server initialization timeouts in stdio-based servers
- Stream management during server startup
- Ready message handling between client and server
- Message synchronization in multi-server setup

## Key Findings
1. Server successfully sends ready message but stream management is problematic
2. Multiple attempts to fix the issue revealed deeper architectural concerns:
   - Stream lifecycle management
   - Message synchronization
   - Client-server connection stability
3. Current initialization flow has potential race conditions
4. Logging shows message delivery but connection stability issues

## Next Steps
1. Investigate stream management during server startup
2. Review the entire server initialization flow
3. Consider implementing a more robust connection protocol
4. Add comprehensive logging for stream lifecycle events
5. Implement proper stream cleanup and error handling

## Development Principles
- Prioritize connection stability
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add detailed logging throughout the system
- Consider timeout configurations carefully

## Technical Decisions
- Will maintain backward compatibility with existing server configurations
- Planning to implement a new ServerManager class for handling multiple connections
- Will use async/await for managing multiple server connections
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - Main feature branch: `feature/multi-server-support`
  - Each task will have its own branch branching from `feature/multi-server-support`
  - Task branches will be merged back to `feature/multi-server-support`
  - Final feature will be merged to `main`

## Next Steps
Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation, starting with configuration structure updates.

## Notes
- This is a significant architectural change requiring careful testing
- Need to ensure backward compatibility for existing use cases
- Will need to update documentation to reflect new multi-server capabilities
