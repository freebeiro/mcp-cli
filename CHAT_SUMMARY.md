# MCP-CLI Development Chat Summary

## Project Context
- **Project**: Model Context Provider CLI (MCP-CLI)
- **Repository Location**: /Users/freebeiro/Documents/fcr/claudefiles/mcp-cli
- **Current Branch**: feature/multi-server-support

## Main Objective
Enable the MCP-CLI to work with multiple servers simultaneously, as currently it only supports connecting to one server at a time.

## Current State
- Single server connection support only
- Server configuration in `server_config.json`
- Command routing to single server
- Basic CLI interface for server interaction

## Planned Changes
We're implementing multi-server support in three phases:

### Phase 1: Configuration & Basic Structure
- [ ] Update configuration structure
- [ ] Create ServerManager class
- [ ] Basic multi-server connection handling

### Phase 2: Command Interface
- [ ] Add server context switching
- [ ] Implement new multi-server commands
- [ ] Update command routing

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Parallel command execution
- [ ] Server group operations
- [ ] Enhanced status reporting

## Progress Log

### Session 1 (Current)
1. **Analysis**: 
   - Identified limitation in current architecture for single server support
   - Analyzed main.py and server_config.json for required changes
2. **Setup**:
   - Created new branch 'feature/multi-server-support'
   - Created this CHAT_SUMMARY.md file for tracking progress

## Current Task: Update Server Configuration
**Branch**: `task/update-server-config`

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Backup Current Configuration** (Safety Step) âœ…
   - Create a backup of current server_config.json
   - Add to .gitignore to prevent committing backups

2. **Update Configuration Schema** (Small Change)
   - Add version field to track config schema version
   - Add new fields while maintaining backward compatibility
   - Test loading of old config format still works

3. **Add Multi-Server Support in Config** (Core Change)
   - Add server groups concept
   - Add server priority/order within groups
   - Add server aliases for easy reference
   - Test with example multi-server setup

4. **Update Config Loading Code** (Integration)
   - Modify config.py to handle new structure
   - Add validation for new fields
   - Add migration support for old config format
   - Add unit tests for config loading

5. **Documentation Update**
   - Update config schema documentation
   - Add migration guide for existing users
   - Document new multi-server capabilities

### Testing Strategy for Each Step:
- Create unit tests before making changes
- Verify backward compatibility
- Test with various server combinations
- Validate error handling

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Old config files still work without modification
- [ ] New config structure supports multiple active servers
- [ ] Config loading provides clear error messages
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated

## Technical Decisions
- Will maintain backward compatibility with existing server configurations
- Planning to implement a new ServerManager class for handling multiple connections
- Will use async/await for managing multiple server connections
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - Main feature branch: `feature/multi-server-support`
  - Each task will have its own branch branching from `feature/multi-server-support`
  - Task branches will be merged back to `feature/multi-server-support`
  - Final feature will be merged to `main`

## Next Steps
Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation, starting with configuration structure updates.

## Notes
- This is a significant architectural change requiring careful testing
- Need to ensure backward compatibility for existing use cases
- Will need to update documentation to reflect new multi-server capabilities
